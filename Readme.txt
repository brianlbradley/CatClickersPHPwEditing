 This dynamic Cat Clickers’ model is for use with a database table using mySql and PHP.
This allows edits within the form and has fields for inputting new cats and new image path at the top.  A delete button allows for a validation. All that’s left is the click count, which i didn’t include in this model.  
######
1. Set your database configuration on config.php
2. Import the users.sql file in your database.
